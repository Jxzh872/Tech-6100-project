Autonomous Medication Delivery Robot
This project is on progress.

## Overview
This project aims to design and develop an affordable autonomous indoor robot capable of transporting medicine and pill bottles within healthcare facilities. The robot will incorporate mechanisms for object retrieval and transportation, reducing manual workload and improving efficiency in healthcare settings.

## Features
- **Autonomous Navigation**: preprogramming path-following and obstacle detection.
- **Object Manipulation**: Equipped with a robotic arm for picking and placing medication containers.
- **QR Code Recognition**: Identifies and verifies medications using a camera-based scanning system.
- **Remote Monitoring**: Live camera feed accessible via a user tablet.
- **Wireless Charging**: Automatically returns to the charging station when idle.

## System Architecture
### Hardware Components
- **MCU**: Raspberry Pi 5 (Main controller), Motor 2040 motor driver
- **Chassis**: Mobile base with four omnidirectional wheels
- **Motors**: Four small DC motors with gearboxes and encoders
- **Sensors**: Ultrasonic sensor for obstacle detection, IR sensor array for light tracing
- **Camera**: For live feed and QR code scanning
- **Battery**: 14.8V Li-ion battery with a step-down circuit to 5V
- **Grabber Mechanism**: Servo motor for gripping and step motor pulley system for movement
- **Tablet**: User interface for medicine selection and destination input
